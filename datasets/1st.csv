"My Thursdays no longer feel like Thursdays to me and my Wednesdays stopped being Wednesdays to me since the last November, the day when Naruto manga ended. I beg to differ that Chinese Water Torture is the world’s deadliest torture. Naruto’s unrelated fillers are more excruciating than it. Date Hayato, I swear on my craze for Naruto, if you don’t stop with this filler shit, I will find you and I will kill you. Though it’s been 4 months only but, it feels like a millennium has passed without Naruto. It’s becoming really hard to survive every day just by watching AMVs. Bring back Naruto Canon episode.",Virat-Sardana
